A lot of the cloud hosting costs are for instances that are renting too much CPU
or Memory and could be scaled down to save money. There are also instances that only
need to run during office hours so waste money for 16 hours and day and weekends.

The plan is to use the logs collected by Munin. The amount of unused resources will
be averaged over a given time period and an email will be sent if they are unacceptable.


Steps:

The script needs to find RRD files generated by Munin.

Filter those that have been updates recently.

Use RRDtools to find the average usage of memory and CPU for the time period.

Look for drops in usage outside of office hours that could show a server could be turned off. 

Select any servers that should be flagged-up.

Convert the data to a human readable format.

Send a report.
